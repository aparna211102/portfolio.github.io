                <h2>Objective:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Potatoes are the base of indian food. If it's get destroyed, will badly affect one's life. </li>
                    <li>To detect the disease in potato leaf using deep learning method.</li>
                    <li>This method will help farmers and agriculture based companies as it can detect the disease at early stage.</li>
                    <li>Reduces the chances of damage.</li> 
                    <li>Can also tell wheather a leaf is potato leaf or not.</li>

                    <li>I used Google Colab for this project.</li> 
                    <li>You can give it a proper platform and can contact me.ðŸ˜Œ</li>

                <h2>Model used: CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>It is used for image classification.</li>
                    <li>Convolutional Neural Network is very good at image classification</li>
                    <li>Process:<ul>
                        <li>The work happens in the so-called convolution layer. To do this, we define a filter that determines how large the partial images we are looking at should be, and a step length that decides how many pixels we continue between calculations, i.e. how close the partial images are to each other</li>
                        <li>The next step is the pooling layer. From a purely computational point of view, the same thing happens here as in the convolution layer, with the difference that we only take either the average or maximum value from the result, depending on the application. This preserves small features in a few pixels that are crucial for the task solution.</li>
                        <li>Finally, there is a fully-connected layer, as we already know it from regular neural networks. Now that we have greatly reduced the dimensions of the image, we can use the tightly meshed layers. Here, the individual sub-images are linked again in order to recognize the connections and carry out the classification.</li>
                    </ul></li>
                    <li>It has ability to work with incomplete knowledge.</li>                    
                    <li>Efficiently performing prediction or identification.</li>
                  </ol>
