                <p><br>The portfolio can have the same purpose as a CV. Most CVs are written with text, while the portfolio is for showcasing, so it is visual with images and often more detailed than the CV.
                    <br><br>It is a place where you can show your work experience and showcase the projects that you are most proud of.
                    <br><br>Your online portfolio can be shared with its link to companies, hiring managers, and recruiters, so that they can notice you.
                    <br><br>It is about showing and giving others an understanding of who you are as a professional</p>
