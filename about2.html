                <h2>What is online whiteboard?</h2>
                <p><br>Online whiteboards can be used for the same purpose as a real whiteboard, but without the limitations of a real whiteboard. Made during pandemic
                (in the year 2021) when our classes were going on in online mode and it is hard to interact with teachers only via PPt presentation.
                <br><br>Online whiteboards are software solutions that come along as apps or browser-based tools. They support teams to collaborate visually over distance in real-time.</p>
